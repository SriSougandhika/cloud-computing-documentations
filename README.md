# Cloud-computing-documentations
This repository provides comprehensive documentation on key cloud computing technologies, including Clone calls, Docker, Docker Swarm, Mininet, App Armor, and Gluster FS. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding and implementing these tools in cloud infrastructure setups.
All of the work is done on an Ubuntu system by setting up a virtual machine for it on Windows 11 PC, using **Oracle VM VirtualBox**.
The source of my documentations is mainly from [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/manuals/). Kindly visit the mentioned website for more detailed instructions. 

## Clone Calls
Clone calls are system calls used in Linux for creating processes and containers. Detailed documentation at [Clone Calls](./CloneCall_Documentation.pdf)

## Docker
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Detailed documentation at [Docker](./Docker_Documentation.pdf)

## Docker Swarm
Docker Swarm allows you to manage a cluster of Docker engines. Detailed documentation at [Docker Swarm](./DockerSwarm_Documentation.pdf)

## Mininet
Mininet is a network emulator that creates a virtual network on your machine. Detailed documentation at [Mininet](./Mininet_Documentation.pdf)

## App Armor
AppArmor is a Linux security module for restricting programs' capabilities. Detailed documentation at [App Armor](./AppArmor_Documentation.pdf)

## Gluster FS
Gluster FS is a scalable network filesystem suitable for cloud storage. Detailed documentation at [Gluster FS](./GlusterFS_Documentation.pdf)

## Networking in Docker
Networking helps toggle certain options to make the communication more effective in certain use cases. Detailed documentation at [Docker Networking](./DockerNetworking_Documentation.pdf)
